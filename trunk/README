Vidalia is a cross-platform controller GUI for Tor, built using the Qt toolkit. 
Vidalia runs on any platform supported by Qt 4.1, including Windows, Mac OS X, 
and Linux or other Unix variants using the X11 window system.

Vidalia allows you to start and stop Tor, view the status of Tor at a glance, 
and monitor Tor's bandwidth usage. Vidalia also makes it easy to contribute to 
the Tor network by helping you setup a Tor server, if you wish.
