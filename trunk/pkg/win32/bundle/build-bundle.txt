                Building the Vidalia/Tor/Privoxy Bundle


1. Create a base directory under which the necessary sources will be extracted
and place the .nsi file in it. For this example, we will just use C:\bundle\.
      
       C:\bundle\bundle.nsi

2. Create directories for each component in the bundle.

        C:\bundle\privoxy\
        C:\bundle\tor\
        C:\bundle\vidalia\

3. Modify the appropriate version values (VIDALIA_VERSION, TOR_VERSION, and
PRIVOXY_VERSION) at the top of the .nsi file.

4. Create directories for the appropriate versions of each component.

        C:\bundle\privoxy\3.0.3\
        C:\bundle\tor\0.1.1.18-rc\
        C:\bundle\vidalia\0.0.4\

5. Install Vidalia, Tor, and Privoxy to the directories you created for them.

6. Modify Privoxy's config.txt file as follows:

    * Add "forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 ." (without quotes) to the top
    * Comment out "logfile privoxy.log" in Section 1.5
    * Comment out "jarfile jar.log" in Section 1.6
    * Uncomment "log-messages 1" in Section 6 and change the '1' to a '0'

7. Install Tor to the directory you created for its version. Remember that you
may need to grab the torrc.sample file from %APPDATA%\Tor that was created by
the installer and place it in the directory for the bundle's version of Tor.

8. Run the .nsi script. The bundle will be named according the the versions
you specified in Step 4 and placed in the base directory created in Step 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each additional release of some component of the bundle, follow Steps 4-9.
If the version of some component didn't change, you can skip its step. For
example, if the version of Privoxy didn't change then you can skip Step 6.
