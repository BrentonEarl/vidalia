<h1>Message Log</h1>
<hr />

The message log lets you see status information about a running Tor process.

<a name="basic"/>
Each message has a <i>severity</i> associated with it, ranging from
<b>Error</b> (most serious) to <b>Debug</b> (most verbose). See the help
section on <a href="#severities">message severities</a> for more information.


<a name="severities"/>
<h3>Message Severities</h3>
<p>
A message's severity tells you how important the message is. A higher severity
message usually indicates that something has gone wrong with Tor. Lower
severity messages appear frequently during normal Tor operations and usually
do not need to be logged.
</p>

<p>
The possible message severities, from most severe to least severe, are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Error</b>: Messages that appear when something has gone very wrong and
    Tor cannot proceed. These messages will be highlighted in <i>red</i> in the
    message log.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Warning</b>: Message that only appear when something has gone wrong
    with Tor, but are not fatal and Tor will continue running. These messages
    will be highlighted in <i>yellow</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Notice</b>: Messages that appear infrequently during normal Tor
    operation and are not considered errors, but you still may care about.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Info</b>: Messages that appear frequently during normal Tor operation
    and are not usually of interest to most users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Debug</b>: Extremely verbose messages that are primarily of interest to
    developers. You should generally not log debug messages unless you know
    what you are doing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Most users should only log <i>Error</i>, <i>Warning</i>, and <i>Notice</i>
messages.
</p>

<p>
To select which message severities you would like to see, do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Open the message log from the Vidalia tray menu.</li>
  <li>Click on <i>Show Settings</i> at the bottom of the message log window.</li>
  <li>
    Check message severities you would like to see from the Message Filter
    group on the left and uncheck message severities you would like to hide.
  </li>
  <li>Click <i>Save Settings</i> to apply your new message filter.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Logging to a File</h3>
<p>
Vidalia can also write log messages to a file, as well as logging them in the
message log window. To enable logging to a file, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the message log from the Vidalia tray menu.</li>
  <li>Click on <i>Show Settings</i> at the bottom of the message log window.</li>
  <li>Check the box labeled <i>Save Messages to File</i>.
  <li>
    If you would like to change the file to which messages will be written,
    either type the path and filename into the text box, or click <i>Browse</i>
    to navigate to a location for your log file.
  </li>
  <li>Click <i>Save Settings</i> to save your log destination.</li>
</ol>
