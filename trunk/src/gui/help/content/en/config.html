<h1>Configuring Vidalia and Tor</h1>
<hr />

<p>
Vidalia allows you to configure some of the most commonly modified aspects of
Vidalia and Tor. It also lets you set up and manage a <a
href="server.html">Tor server</a> so you can help the Tor network
grow.
</p>

<a name="general"/>
<h3>General Settings</h3>
<p>
Settings on the <i>General</i> page are the most commonly modified settings.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tor Directory</b>: 
    This is the directory in which Vidalia will look
    for your Tor installation. If you have multiple versions of Tor installed,
    you can tell Vidalia which version you would like to run by clicking the
    <i>Browse</i> button and navigating to the particular Tor installation you
    want.
  </li>
  <li><b>Startup Options</b>:
    This setting allows you to have Vidalia automatically start Tor when
    Vidalia starts. You can also configure Vidalia to run when your system
    starts (<i>Windows only</i>).
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="server"/>
<h3>Server Settings</h3>
<p>
<i>
  See <a href="server.html">this file</a> for detailed
  information about setting up and managing a Tor server.
</i>
</p>

<a name="advanced"/>
<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
<p>
The settings on the <i>Advanced Settings</i> page should generally only be
modified by more experienced users.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Control Port</b>:
    The <i>Control Port</i> is the port which Vidalia uses to talk to Tor.
    This doesn't need to be changed unless you have a conflict with another
    service on your machine.
  </li>
  <li><b>Alternate Tor Configuration File</b>:
    You can use this option to have Vidalia start Tor using a 
    specific <i>torrc</i>, Tor's configuration file.
  </li>
  <li><b>Permissions</b>:
    If you set this option, Tor will <i>setuid</i> to this User or
    <i>setgid</i> to this group when it starts up.
  </li>
</ul>
