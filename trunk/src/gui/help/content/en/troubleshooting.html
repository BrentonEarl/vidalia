<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<hr />

Listed below are some of the common problems or questions people have while
running Tor. If you can't find anything about the particular problem you're
having, check out our website at <i>www.vidalia-project.net</i> for more
support and information.

<a name="start"/>
<h3>I Can't Start Tor</h3>
<p>
The most likely reason that Vidalia could not start Vidalia is looking for
your Tor installation in the wrong directory. You can tell Vidalia where Tor
is located by updating the <i>Tor Directory</i> option in the <a
href="config.html#general">general configuration settings</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another possible reason that Tor cannot start is because there is already
another Tor process running. Check your list of running process and stop the
previous Tor process, if you find one. Then, try running Tor again.
</p>
<p>
If that did not help, check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor printed any information about errors it encountered
while trying to start.
</p>

<a name="connect"/>
<h3>Vidalia Can't Connect to Tor</h3>
<p>
Vidalia manages Tor by communicating with it via Tor's <i>control port</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The most common reason that Vidalia cannot connect to Tor is because Tor
started, but encountered an error and exited immediately. You should
check your <a href="log.html">message log</a> to see if Tor reported any
errors while it started.
</p>
<p>
If Tor is listening on a different port than Vidalia expects, Vidalia will
be unable to connect to Tor. You rarely need to change this setting, but if
there is another service running on your machine that conflicts with Tor's 
control port, you will need to specify a different port. You can change this
setting in Vidalia's <a href="config.html#advanced">advanced configuration
settings</a>.
</p>

<h3>Vidalia Can't Stop Tor</h3>
<p>
If Vidalia cannot stop Tor, you should check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor reported any errors while trying to exit.
