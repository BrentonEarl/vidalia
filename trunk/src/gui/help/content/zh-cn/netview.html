<h1>Network Viewer</h1>
<hr />

<p>
The network viewer lets you see routers in the Tor network and where
your traffic is going.
</p>


<a name="overview"/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
When you want to communicate anonymously through Tor (say, connecting to a
website), Tor creates a tunnel, or <i>circuit</i>, of encrypted connections
through a series of routers on the network. Your application's traffic is then
sent as a <i>stream</i> through that circuit. For efficieny, multiple streams
may share the same circuit.
</p>


<a name="status"/>
<h3>Router Status</h3>
<p>
On the left side of the network view, you will see a list of routers in the
Tor network. Next to each router is an icon indicating that router's status.
The following table summarizes the possible router status icons:
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-unresponsive.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is offline or simply not responding.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-hibernating.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is <i>hibernating</i>, meaning it is online, but has used up as
    much bandwidth as the operator is willing to allow for a given time
    period.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-none.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online, but has shown only minimal throughput.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-low.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 20 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-med.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 60 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-high.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 400 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
All bandwidth values are estimates based on the minimum of either 
the maximum bandwidth sustained input or output over any ten second period 
in the past day.
