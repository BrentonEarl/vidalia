Instruction for Building and Installing Vidalia from Source

   1. Make sure you have Qt 4.1 and Tor 0.1.1.13 or later installed.
   
   2. Run ./configure && make
   
   3. When the previous command finishes, Vidalia's binary will be
      placed in the bin/ directory.
   
   4. Optionally, you can run make install to install Vidalia into
      your /usr/local/bin/ directory. 


NOTE: If you get linker errors like bin/ld: cannot find -lQtGui_debug, then
you will need to replace the "./configure" command in Step 2 with "./configure
release" to avoid linking against the debug versions of Qt's libraries.
