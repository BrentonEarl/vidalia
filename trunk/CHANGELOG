0.0.4   09-May-2006
  o Add a fixed set of Windows .ico files from Dan Christensen. Our
    contributed set in 0.0.3 apparently had a blank image in it that some old
    Windowses would use instead of the icon that actually had an image.
  o Add an option for servers to check periodically to see if their public IP
    address has changed.
  o Give servers the option to shut down after 30 seconds, to give clients
    time to find new circuits, instead of just always killing Tor immediately.
  o Improve GUI responsiveness when waiting for the Tor process to finish
    starting up.
  o Be smarter about guessing the default location of Tor in non-English
    Windowses.

  
0.0.3   13-Apr-2006
  o Fixed a server configuration bug that caused people to not really be a
    middleman node, even though the checkbox told them they were.
  o Fixed a bug in choosing a default language that caused help documents to
    sometimes not appear.
  o Fixed the Win32 bundle installer to not leave 2 files and a registry key 
    laying around after an uninstall. Also give users the option of launching
    Vidalia when the solo installer is finished.
  o Fixed a bug where Vidalia would ignore Windows when asked to shut down
    because the system is restarting.
  o Improved tray icon support on older Windowses. Also started using a new
    set of icons created by Matt Hanson, based on our previous set by Corinna
    Habets.
  o Improved help document accessibility by adding "Help" buttons to many
    dialogs and error message boxes.

  
0.0.2   02-Apr-2006
  o Added an integrated help browser and documentation.
  o Added exit policy configuration support for servers.
  o Added support for language translations and language selection.
  o Added a Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) translation from Wu Xiaoguong.
  o Added support for changing Vidalia's interface style.
  o Aesthetic improvements in many dialogs.

    - Starting/stopping/monitoring Tor

    - Message log
