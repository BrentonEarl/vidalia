                   Vidalia Version Specification

Vidalia releases will follow the following versioning convention:

  Version ::= <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<MICRO>[-svn]
  MAJOR   ::= Integer >= 0
  MINOR   ::= Integer >= 0
  MICRO   ::= Integer >= 0

  MICRO will start at 1 and increase monotonically until a stable release, at
  which point MINOR will be inremented MICRO will be set to 0 for a stable
  release and reset to 1 for the subsequent testing release.
  
  MAJOR will be incremented following several MINOR stable releases in which
  extensive functionality has been added or modified. Developers will use
  their discretion in determining MAJOR releases.
  
  The -svn flag will be used to denote the latest snapshot in the Subversion
  repository. It will be removed for an official release. For example,
  0.0.2-svn would become 0.0.2 when it is officially released.

  An example of a possible sequence of versions is as follows:

    0.0.1
    0.0.2
    0.0.3
    0.1.0  <-- Stable
    0.1.1
    0.1.2
    0.1.3
    1.0.0  <-- Stable
