Pre-competition-deadline Goals:
  * Circuit and stream visualization
  
  * Simplified (coarse-grained) rate-limiting control
  
  * Create a bundle for Mac OS X, similar to what we have for Windows
  
  * Create a Vidalia package for at least one Linux distro (preferably Debian)

  
Pie-in-the-sky Goals:
  * Circuit and stream control. "click-click-click, I want that circuit"
  
  * Scheduled rate-limiting, so the user can adjust their bandwidth
    limits depending on what time of day it is.


Miscellaneous Tasks:
  * Improve window transparency support. In particular, figure out how to do the
    following correctly on X11 (from the Qt docs):
      "This feature is available on Mac OS X, X11 platforms that support the Composite 
      extension, and Windows 2000 and later.

      Note that under X11 you need to have a composite manager running, and the X11 
      specific _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY atom needs to be supported by the window manager 
      you are using."
