<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<hr />

Listed below are some of the common problems or questions people have while
running Tor. If you can't find anything about the particular problem you're
having, check out our website at <i>www.vidalia-project.net</i> for more
support and information.

<a name="start"/>
<h3>I Can't Start Tor</h3>
<p>
The most likely reason that Vidalia could not start Tor is because Vidalia is
looking for your Tor installation in the wrong directory. You can tell Vidalia
where Tor is located by updating the <i>Tor Executable</i> option in the 
<a href="config.html#general">general configuration settings</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another possible reason that Tor cannot start is because there is already
another Tor process running. Check your list of running process and stop the
previous Tor process, if you find one. Then, try running Tor again.
</p>
<p>
If that did not help, check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor printed any information about errors it encountered
while trying to start.
</p>

<a name="connect"/>
<h3>Vidalia Can't Connect to Tor</h3>
<p>
Vidalia manages Tor by communicating with it via Tor's <i>control port</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The most common reason that Vidalia cannot connect to Tor is because Tor
started, but encountered an error and exited immediately. You should
check your <a href="log.html">message log</a> to see if Tor reported any
errors while it started.
</p>
<p>
If Tor is listening on a different port than Vidalia expects, Vidalia will
be unable to connect to Tor. You rarely need to change this setting, but if
there is another service running on your machine that conflicts with Tor's 
control port, you will need to specify a different port. You can change this
setting in Vidalia's <a href="config.html#advanced">advanced configuration
settings</a>.
</p>

<a name="password"/>
<h3>Why is Vidalia asking me for a "control password"?</h3>
<p>
Vidalia interacts with the Tor software via Tor's "control port". The control
port lets Vidalia receive status updates from Tor, request a new identity,
configure Tor's settings, etc. Each time Vidalia starts Tor, Vidalia
sets a random password for Tor's control port to prevent other applications
from also connecting to the control port and potentially compromising your
anonymity.
</p>

<p>
Usually this process of generating and setting a random control password
happens in the background. There are three common situations, though, where
Vidalia may prompt you for a password:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You're already running Vidalia and Tor. For example, this situation
    can happen if you installed the Vidalia bundle and now you're trying
    to run the Tor Browser Bundle. In that case, you'll need to close the
    old Vidalia and Tor before you can run this one.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Vidalia crashed, but left Tor running with the last known random
    password. After you restart Vidalia, it generates a new random password,
    but Vidalia can't talk to Tor, because the random passwords are
    different.</p>
    
    <p>If the dialog that prompts you for a control password has a <i>Reset</i>
    button, you can click the button and Vidalia will restart Tor with a new
    random control password.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you do not see a <i>Reset</i> button, or if Vidalia is unable to
    restart Tor for you, you can still fix the problem manually. Simply
    go into your process or task manager, and terminate the Tor process. Then
    use Vidalia to restart Tor and all will work again.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You had previously set Tor to run as a service. When Tor is set to run
    as a service, it starts up when the system boots. If you configured Tor to
    start as a service through Vidalia, a random password was set and saved in
    Tor. When you reboot, Tor starts up and uses the random password it saved.
    You login and start up Vidalia. Vidalia attempts to talk to the already
    running Tor. Vidalia generates a random password, but it is different than
    the saved password in the Tor service.</p>
  
    <p>You need to reconfigure Tor to not be a service. See the Tor wiki page on
    running <a
    href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#WinNTService">
    Tor as a service</a> for more information on how to remove the Tor service.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<a name="torexited"/> 
<h3>Tor Exited Unexpectedly</h3> 
<p> 
If Tor exits immediately after trying to start, you most likely have
another Tor process already running. Check the <a href="log.html">message log</a> to
see if any of the last few messages in the list are highlighted in yellow and
contain a message similar to the following:
</p>
<pre>
connection_create_listener(): Could not bind to 127.0.0.1:9050: Address already in use. 
Is Tor already running?
</pre>
<p>
If you find an error message like the one above, you will need to stop the other
Tor process before starting a new one with Vidalia. On Windows, you would need
to look for <i>tor.exe</i> in your Task Manager. On most other operating systems,
the <i>ps</i> command can help you find the other Tor process.
</p>
<p>
If Tor had been running successfully for awhile (that is, longer than a few
seconds), then you should check the <a href="log.html">message log</a> for
information about any errors Tor experienced before it exited. Such errors
will be highlighted in either red or yellow.
</p>

<a name="stop"/>
<h3>Vidalia Can't Stop Tor</h3>
<p>
If Vidalia cannot stop Tor, you should check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor reported any errors while trying to exit.
