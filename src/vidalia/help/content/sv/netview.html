<h1>Nätverkskarta</h1>
<hr />

<p>
The network viewer lets you see relays in the Tor network and where
your traffic is going.
</p>


<a name="overview"/>
<h3>Översikt</h3>
<p>
When you want to communicate anonymously through Tor (say, connecting to a
website), Tor creates a tunnel, or <i>circuit</i>, of encrypted connections
through a series of relays on the network. Your application's traffic is then
sent as a <i>stream</i> through that circuit. For efficiency, multiple streams
may share the same circuit.
</p>

<a name="netmap"/>
<h3>Nätverkskarta</h3>
<p>
The network map consists of a map of the world, with red pinpoints indicating
the geographic location of relays in the Tor network. Green lines are drawn
between relays to indicate the path of circuits that your Tor client has
created through the Tor network.
</p>
<p>
You can zoom in on locations in the map by clicking the <b>Zooma In</b> and
<b>Zooma Ut</b> buttons in the toolbar. You can also scroll around on the map
by clicking on the map and then dragging it in whatever direction you would
like to move the map.
</p>
<p>
The geographic location of a Tor relay is determined by looking up the IP
address of the relay in a GeoIP database, created by MaxMind and located at
geoip.vidalia-project.net.
</p>
<p>
In the middle of the dialog, below the network map, you will see a list of
your current circuits, as well as any application traffic currently on those
circuits. When the network map first loads, you will probably see a connection
to geoip.vidalia-project.net, which occurs when Vidalia is looking up
geographic information for the list of Tor relays. It is important to note
that this request is done through Tor, so your location is not revealed to the
GeoIP relay. The results of the lookups will be cached locally in order to
reduce load on Vidalia's GeoIP relays.
</p>

<h3>Routers ställning</h3>
<p>
On the left side of the network view, you will see a list of relays in the
Tor network. Next to each relay is an icon indicating that relay's status.
The following table summarizes the possible relay status icons:
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-unresponsive.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The relay is offline or simply not responding.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-hibernating.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The relay is <i>hibernating</i>, meaning it is online, but has used up as
    much bandwidth as the operator is willing to allow for a given time
    period.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-none.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The relay is online, but has shown only minimal throughput.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-low.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The relay is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 20 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-med.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The relay is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 60 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-high.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The relay is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 400 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
All bandwidth values are estimates based on the minimum of either 
the maximum bandwidth sustained input or output over any ten second period 
in the past day.

<h3>Routers detaljen</h3>
<p>
The relay details panel at the right side of the screen gives you details
about the relay or relays currently selected in the 
<a href="#relaylist">routerlista</a>. If you have selected a circuit or stream
in the list of your current circuits and streams, this panel will show you
details about each relay through which your traffic is currently being sent.
</p>
<p>
The fields that you may see in the panel are as follows (<i>Note</i>: not all
of these fields will always be present):
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Plats</b></td>
  <td>Plats var liggar det router.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>IP-address</b></td>
  <td>IP address at which this Tor relay can be reached.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Plattform</b></td>
  <td>
    Operating system information and Tor version on which this relay is
    currently running.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Bandbredd</b></td>
  <td>
    Estimated maximum amount of bandwidth that the directory relays have 
    seen this relay handle recently.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Uptid</b></td>
  <td>
    Length of time this relay has been available, which can be used to help
    estimate this relay's stability.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Senast uppdaterad</b></td>
  <td>Datum när det routers information har senast uppdaterad.</td>
