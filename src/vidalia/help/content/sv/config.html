<h1>Konfigurerar Vidalia och Tor</h1>
<hr />

<p>
Vidalia allows you to configure some of the most commonly modified aspects of
Vidalia and Tor. It also lets you set up and manage a <a
href="server.html">Tor relay</a> so you can help the Tor network
grow.
</p>

<a name="general"/>
<h3>Allmänt-inställningar</h3>
<p>
Settings on the <i>Allmänt</i> page are the most commonly modified settings.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Körbar fil för Tor</b>: 
    This is the Tor executable that Vidalia will run when you select
    <i>Start</i> from the tray menu. If you have multiple versions of Tor installed,
    you can tell Vidalia which version you would like to run by clicking the
    <i>Bläddra</i> button and navigating to the particular Tor installation you
    want.
  </li>
  <li><b>Startup Options</b>:
    This setting allows you to have Vidalia automatically start Tor when
    Vidalia starts. You can also configure Vidalia to run when your system
    starts (<i>Bara Windows</i>).
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="network"/>
<h3>Nätverk-inställningar</h3>
<p>
The <i>Nätverk</i> settings page lets you change how Tor connects to the Tor
network.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Jag använder en proxy till internet</b>:
    If your Internet connection requires an HTTP proxy, you can configure Tor
    to send all of its directory requests and Tor relay connections through
    your proxy. You must specify at least the hostname or address of your
    proxy, and the port on which your proxy is listening for connections. If
    your proxy requires authentication, you can also enter the
    <i>Username</i> and <i>Password</i> you use to connect to your proxy.
    Otherwise, you can leave those fields blank.
  </li>
  <li><b>Min brandvägg gevs mig avsluta bara till säkra portarna</b>:
    If you are behind a restrictive firewall or proxy that limits the ports you
    are able to connect to, you can configure Tor to connect directly only to
    relays listening on the ports allowed by your firewall or proxy. Simply
    enter a list of ports permitted by your firewall or proxy, separated by
    commas. (<i>Example: 80,443,8080</i>)
  </li>
  <li><b>Min internetleverantör blockerar anslutningar till Tor-nätverket</b>:
    If your ISP (Internet Service Provider) blocks connections to the Tor
    network, Tor can attempt to avoid being filtered by encrypting its
    directory connections and connecting to the Tor network through relays
    called <i>bridges</i> (Tor 0.2.0.3-alpha or newer only). You can add
    bridge relays by specifying either their address and port number, or
    their address, port number, and fingerprint.<br>

    Below are examples of valid bridge address formats:
    <ul>
      <li>
        128.213.48.13:8080
      </li>
      <li>
        128.213.48.13:8080 1054 13B1 DBDA F867 B226 74D2 52DF 3D9F A367 1F73
      </li>
      <li>
        128.213.48.13:8080 105413B1DBDAF867B22674D252DF3D9FA3671F73
      </li>
    </ul>
    Even if you do not know any bridge relay addresses, checking this checkbox
    may still be helpful. Tor will encrypt its directory requests, which can
    defeat blocking mechanisms that try to filter Tor's requests for
    information about other relays. If connections to normal Tor relays are
    also blocked, then you will need to learn a bridge relay address somehow
    and add it here. See the help topic on <a href="bridges.html#finding">finding
    bridge relays</a> for more information on how to learn new bridge relay
    addresses and fingerprints.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Utdelning-inställningar</h3>
<p>
<i>
  See <a href="server.html">this help topic</a> for detailed
  information about setting up and managing a Tor relay.
</i>
</p>

<a name="appearance"/>
<h3>Utseende-inställningar</h3>
<p>
The settings on the <i>Utseende</i> page allow you to customize the
look and feel of Vidalia.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Språk</b>:
    Vidalia's interface has been translated into many languages by helpful
    volunteers. When Vidalia is first run, it will try to guess which language
    your computer is currently using. If Vidalia guesses incorrectly, or if
    you prefer a different language, you can choose another language from the
    dropdown box. You will need to restart Vidalia after changing the
    displayed language for the changes to take effect.
  </li>
  <li><b>Stil</b>:
    In most cases, Vidalia will default to using your platform's default
    interface style. If you dislike the default, you can choose whichever
    interface style you prefer from the dropdown box.
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="advanced"/>
<h3>Avancerat-inställningar</h3>
<p>
The settings on the <i>Avancerat</i> page should generally only be
modified by more experienced users.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>KontrollAdress Address &amp; port</b>:
    The <i>Kontrollport</i> is the port which Vidalia uses to talk to Tor.
    This doesn't need to be changed unless you have a conflict with another
    service on your machine, or if you are using Vidalia to control and
    monitor a Tor process running on another machine.
  </li>
  <li><b>Kontrollports styrkning</b>:
    Control port authentication is used to limit the applications on your
    machine that can connect to and reconfigure your Tor installation. The
    available authentication methods are:
    <ul>  
      <li>
        <b>Inget</b> -- No authentication is required. Use of this option is
        <b>strongly</b> discouraged. Any application or user on your computer
        can reconfigure your Tor installation.
      </li>
      <li> 
        <b>Lösenord</b> <i>(Default)</i> -- If this method is selected, you
        can specify a password that Tor will require each time a user or
        application connects to Tor's control port. If Vidalia starts Tor for
        you, you can have Vidalia randomly generate a new password each time
        it starts Tor by checking the <i>Randomly Generate</i> checkbox.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cookie</b> -- If cookie authentication is selected, Tor will
        write a file (or, <i>cookie</i>) containing random bytes to its data 
        directory when it starts. Any user or application that tries to
        connect to Tor's control port must be able to provide the contents of
        this cookie.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Konfigurationsfil för Tor</b> <i>(optional)</i>:
    You can use this option to have Vidalia start Tor using a 
    specific <i>torrc</i>, Tor's configuration file. If you leave this field
    blank, Tor will uses its own default torrc location.
  </li>
  <li><b>Tor-datakatalog</b> <i>(optional)</i>:
    You can specify the directory in which Tor will store its saved data,
    such as cached Tor relay information, Tor relay keys, and configuration
    files. If you leave this field blank, Tor will use its own default data
    directory location.
  </li>
  <li><b>Rättigheter</b> <i>(optional, not available on Windows)</i>:
    If you enter a value for <b>Kör som användaren</b>, Tor will <i>setuid</i> to this user
    when it starts.
    If you enter a value for <b>Kör som gruppen</b>, Tor will <i>setgid</i> to this
    group when it starts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hidden Service Settings</h3>
<p>
Hidden services allow you to provide any kind of TCP-based service, e.g.
an HTTP service, to others without revealing your IP address.
