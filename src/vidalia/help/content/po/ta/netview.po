"When you want to communicate anonymously through Tor (say, connecting to a "
"website), Tor creates a tunnel, or <i>circuit</i>, of encrypted connections "
"through a series of relays on the network. Your application's traffic is "
"then sent as a <i>stream</i> through that circuit. For efficiency, multiple "
"streams may share the same circuit."
