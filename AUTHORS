Vidalia is developed by:
  Matt Edman <edmanm@vidalia-project.net>
  Justin Hipple <hipplej@vidalia-project.net>

Contributors: 
  Corinna Habets <corinna@geekin.de> created the images off which
  our application icons are based.

  Ren Bucholz <http://homes.eff.org/~renbucholz/tor/> created some of the
  onion images off of which Corinna's icons and some of our own images are
  based. 

  The Tango Desktop Project <http://tango-project.org> created many of the
  icons used in Vidalia. See LICENSE for details.

  Brandon Nase <http://www.students.dsu.edu/naseb/> designed and built 
  the Vidalia-Project website.

  Matt Hanson <http://www.zuerchertech.com/> tweaked Corinna's images a bit
  and created some .icos based off of them. 
  
  Dan Christensen <http://opello.org/> added additional image formats to 
  the .ico files to support more Windowses. He also created the graph style
  icons in the bandwidth graph settings.

  Geoff Goodell <http://afs.eecs.harvard.edu/~goodell/> supplied us with
  nearly all of the flag icons that we use in the Appearance configuration
  page and network map. He also created the router status icons we use in 
  the network map.

  Michael Zuercher and Adam Tomjack of Zuerchertech LLC
  <http://www.zuerchertech.com> gave us the ZImageView class which handles
  drawing, scrolling and zooming the map image in the Network Viewer.

  Christoph Sieghart (sigi) <http://www.0x2a.at/blog/> gave us some code that
  converts world space coordinates (latitude,longitude) into image space
  coordinates (x,y) which we used in the Net Viewer.
