_Description: Do you want to stop the existing Tor process and let Vidalia start Tor?
 It looks like there is a Tor process already running. If you want to start Tor
 using Vidalia, you might have to stop the existing Tor process. Otherwise you
 will have to enable 'ControlPort' option into Tor as explained in the documentation 
 carried with this package ('/usr/share/doc/vidalia/README.Debian').
 .
 Note that if you choose to let Vidalia start Tor, you will have to manually disable 
 Tor starting automatically on every reboot (See 'README.Debian').
