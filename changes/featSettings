  o Implements a torrc parser and editor and uses that to take every
    tor configuration option from the vidalia.conf file to the
    torrc. Vidalia now just needs to know the minimal information to
    connect to the tor process (ControlPort or ControlSocket and
    authentication) and everything else would be handled through the
    torrc file.
