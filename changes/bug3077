  o Add a way to use the autoconfiguration for ControlPort and SocksPort.
    Tor can now autoconfigure Control and Socks Ports when the default ones
    are in use. This makes it easier to run several different instances of
    TBB at the same time. Resolves bug 3077.
  o Make the AutoPort setting default to false, so that it doesn't
    break backwards compatibility for people that aren't using Vidalia
    inside Tor Browser Bundle.
  o Check tor version and that settings are sanitized before trying to
    use the port autoconfiguration feature. Fixes bug 3843.
  o Provide the necessary fields (Control password, ControlPort) to let 
    TorButton NEWNYM. Vidalia provides these in env vars when it launches
    the Firefox instance. Resolves bug 2659.
