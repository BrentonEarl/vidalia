  New Features:
  o Add a wizard for the special cases where the user starts Vidalia
    while tor has DisableNetwork=1 or the Panic feature enabled. This
    wizard is meant to warn the user about either the Panic feature or
    that she might need to configure a proxy or a bridge before tor
    connects to the outside world. Fixes ticket 2905.
