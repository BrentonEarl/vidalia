  o When Tor has cached enough information it bootstraps faster than
    what takes Vidalia connect to it, so Vidalia does not see the
    event to update the progress bar. Now Vidalia explicitly asks for
    bootstrap-phase when it connects to Tor, and updates the progress
    to what is actually happening instead of hanging in
    "Authenticating to Tor". Fixes bug 4827.
