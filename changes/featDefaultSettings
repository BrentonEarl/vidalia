  o Add a way to handle default settings through a file instead of
    just the hardcoded values. Vidalia will look for a
    vidalia.defaults.conf file in the same place the vidalia.conf file
    is, and from it it will read the default values for each
    configuration option or fall back to the hardcoded default if the
    key isn't present.
